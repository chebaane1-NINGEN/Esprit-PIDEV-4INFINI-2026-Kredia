## Overview

This project was developed as part of the PIDEV – 4th Year Engineering Program at **Esprit School of Engineering** (Academic Year 2025–2026).

Kredia Frontend is a modern Angular-based web application designed to provide an intelligent and user-friendly interface for microfinance services. The platform enables users to simulate loans, apply for credits online, manage investments, track repayments, and interact with AI-powered financial tools.

The application also provides administrative dashboards for monitoring credit requests, analyzing financial risks, and managing user activities through dynamic visualizations and real-time interactions.

The frontend follows a modular and scalable architecture to ensure maintainability, responsiveness, and smooth integration with the Spring Boot backend.
